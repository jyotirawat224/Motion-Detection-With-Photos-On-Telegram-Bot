# Motion-Detection-With-Photos-On-Telegram-Bot
This project detects motion and send photos on telegram bot  helping in detection of any anomaly activity in the absence of  owner. We will create a Telegram bot for the ESP32-CAM that  allows to control board from anywhere to request a photo,  sensor readings or control the flash. This project helps in  monitoring in place of the owner and helps in saving time of  seeing long video clips of cctv in order to check any unusual  activity.

In this the code is Successfully implemented for the project with good accuracy for different conditions. Its been tested it for. The code uses ESP-32 cam and detects the motion of intruders if any. 
In this implementation it detects motion by PIR sensor and made the connection with telegram bot. The person will  receive a message of confirmation to check the connectivity with telegram whenever motion detected.
Further as mentioned in the objective the device will detect the motion and will capture the photo. Not only at day time but also at the night time, it is able to detect the motion. For night time we have used the flashlight to capture a clear picture.
