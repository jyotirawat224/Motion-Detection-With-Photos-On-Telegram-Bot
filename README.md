# Motion-Detection-With-Photos-On-Telegram-Bot
This project detects motion and send photos on telegram bot  helping in detection of any anomaly activity in the absence of  owner. We will create a Telegram bot for the ESP32-CAM that  allows to control board from anywhere to request a photo,  sensor readings or control the flash. This project helps in  monitoring in place of the owner and helps in saving time of  seeing long video clips of cctv in order to check any unusual  activity.
